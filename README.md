# Case Study: Puppet 3 to Puppet 4

These are the slides for a presentation I gave at Puppet Camp Portland 2016.

## Easy usage

You can view a [PDF of the slides](pdf/slides.pdf) or a [PDF of the slides with speaker notes](pdf/slides_with_notes.pdf).

## Full presentation

The presentation is prepared as a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) presentation. If you want to view
the full presentation, you can open the [index.html](revealjs/index.html) directly, or download and follow the
[full instructions for serving reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#full-setup), running the `grunt`
commands from within the [revealjs](revealjs/) directory.
